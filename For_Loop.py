# for loop

# for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (list,tuple,string) or other iterative objects

# syntax:-

# for var in sequence:
#     statements 1
#     statements 2
#     statements 3
# Rest of the code

# name = "codeyug"
# for var in name:
#     print(var)

# for i in range(1,11):
#     print(i,end=" ")

# for i in range(1,11):
#     print(i+1)

# digits = [0,1,5]
# for i in digits:
#     print(i)
# else:
#     print("no items left")

# digits = [0,1,5]
# for i in digits:
#     print(i)
# else:
#     print("no items left")


# nested loops

# adj = ['tasy','red','big']
# fruit=['apple','orange','mango']
# for x in adj:
#     for y in fruit:
#         print(x,y)


# # 1
# for i in range(1,6):
#     print(i)

# # 2
# word = "Python"
# for letter in word:
#     print(letter)

# # 3
# for i in range(2, 11, 2):

# # 4
# total = 0
# for i in range(1, 11):
